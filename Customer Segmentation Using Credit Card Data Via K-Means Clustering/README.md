# Customer Segmentation Using Credit Card Data Via K-Means Clustering

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on customer behavior attributes. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups that can support targeted marketing, personalized offers, and improved customer engagement strategies.

---

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a critical component of modern marketing and customer relationship management. By analyzing customer behavior data, businesses can classify customers into meaningful groups.  
This project leverages clustering algorithms to uncover hidden patterns and provide actionable insights for business decision‑making.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer datasets  
- Apply clustering algorithms (K‑Means)  
- Identify distinct customer segments  
- Provide insights for targeted marketing and customer engagement
